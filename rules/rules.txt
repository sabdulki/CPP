Note: The constructor has the same name as the class, it is always public, and it does not have any return value.

class MyClass {     // The class
  public:           // Access specifier
    MyClass() {     // Constructor
      cout << "Hello World!";
    }
};

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;    // Create an object of MyClass (this will call the constructor)
  return 0;
}

/*
int myNumbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int getArrayLength = sizeof(myNumbers) / sizeof(int);
*/

Pointers are best when the object might not exist or needs to be changeable during the object's lifetime.
References are best when you can guarantee that the object will always exist 
and be tied to the lifetime of the class using it.

File and streams handling
The input and output operation between the executing program and files are known as “disk I/O operation”.

ifstream file(filename);
